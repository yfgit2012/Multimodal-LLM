### Speech-T5

text 
```
The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional 
neural networks in an encoder and decoder configuration. The best performing models also 
connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple 
network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, 
dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely.
