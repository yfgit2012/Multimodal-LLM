This repository serves as an all-in-one  for open-source state-of-the-art **Multimodal Large Language Models**. It provides a unified interface and streamlined pipeline for generating and transforming content across multiple mediums, including **text, images, video, and audio**. By leveraging cutting-edge architectures like Diffusion Transformers and Latent Consistency Models, this suite enables developers to build sophisticated generative workflows with minimal setup.

## 🚀 Core Capabilities

### 1. Text-to-Image (T2I)
Generate high-fidelity visual art and photorealistic images from natural language descriptions. 
* **Supported Models:** Stable Diffusion XL, Midjourney-API integration, and DALL-E 3.
* **Key Features:** Support for negative prompting, LoRA weights, and custom aspect ratios.

### 2. Image-to-Image (I2I)
Transform existing images into new styles or modify specific elements while maintaining structural integrity.
* **Supported Models:** ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and InstructPix2Pix.
* **Key Features:** Style transfer, sketch-to-render, and depth-map guided generation.

### 3. Text-to-Video (T2V)
Convert descriptive prompts into dynamic, high-definition video clips with consistent temporal coherence.
* **Supported Models:** Sora-based architectures, Stable Video Diffusion (SVD), and Lumiere.
* **Key Features:** Frame rate control, motion bucket adjustments, and resolution scaling.

### 4. Image-to-Video (I2V)
Animate static images into 3–5 second cinematic clips using advanced optical flow estimation.
* **Supported Models:** Runway Gen-2 API and Pika Labs wrappers.
* **Key Features:** Keyframe animation, camera motion control (pan, zoom, tilt), and loop generation.

### 5. Text-to-Audio (T2A)
Generate high-quality sound effects, ambient soundscapes, or musical compositions from text.
* **Supported Models:** AudioLDM, MusicLM, and Bark.
* **Key Features:** Stereo output, duration control, and multi-instrumental synthesis.
